Fixes a bug that that a detached git HEAD is not displayed in the [oh-my-fish boxfish theme](https://github.com/joelwanner/theme-boxfish) and uses a yellow background for the error exclamation mark for a better contrast.

---

Hacky solution:

```bash
omf install boxfish
omf theme boxfish
```

Replace `/Users/Gira/.local/share/omf/themes/boxfish/fish_prompt.fish` with this file.
